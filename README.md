# Bliro's Senior Full Stack Engineer Challenge

## Objective:
Enhance the existing meeting application by adding new features and improving the codebase.

## Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Express.
- Understanding of RESTful APIs and database operations.
- Setup:
  - Clone the provided repository containing the initial code for both the client (app) and server (server). 
  - Set up the environment to run both applications using the corresponding README.md files you find in each repository.

## Tasks:

### Pagination

Ooooops, the meeting list in the client application is loading quite a bit. Looks like our user has quite a lot of conversation. Let's improve the user experience by integrating pagination to the system. 

Your CTO spends quite some time on instagram and really loves the endless scroll feature there. He asks you whether we could have the same for the meeting list. 

### Search

Great, application loading times improved dramatically by implementing pagination. We released the feature to the code base - being sure that users will love it - but instead there are lots of complaints coming in. 

> Dear Team
> It's cool to see that the app is loading quicker now. 
> But how do I find any meeting now? 
> Before I used CMD+F and typed the meeting title. 
> Now this is not possible anymore because I have to scroll
> through all my 10.000 meetings first before I can use 
> the CMD+F search for all meetings. 
> Please revert that change again!!!

The CTO is desperate. He fears that he looses his endless scroll feature which he loves so much. Then you have an idea - a search functionality can serve the users needs and still keeps the endless scroll feature. You pitch the idea to the CTO and he buys it. He puts all his hopes into your skills creating a search functionality into the backend. 

### Design

Meeting List yet looks a bit raw. While you were integrating the search capabilities, the CTO pulled out his figma skills and redesigned the meeting list.

Please create customized Material UI compoents. Create and structure them in a way that they are reusable. Please create a theme and define fonts as well as colors there so that your designs can easily be reused by your team mates. 

## Deliverables:

- A README.md file documenting how to set up and run your project as well as a brief description of the work done and any assumptions made.
- A Git repository with your complete project code, including commit history to show your work progress.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality: The application works as expected without errors.
- Code Quality: Clean, modular, and well-commented code.
- Design: Implementation of clean and responsive UI components.
- Problem Solving: Effective use of algorithms and data structures.
- Testing: Adequate test coverage and use of testing best practices.

Please ensure all features are fully implemented within a 4-hour timeframe. Good luck!
